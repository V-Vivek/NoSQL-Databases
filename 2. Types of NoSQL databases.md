# Types of NoSQL databases:

## Document-oriented databases
- These databases store data in the form of documents, which can be in JSON, XML or BSON format. 
- Each document can have a different structure, making them highly flexible. 
- MongoDB is an example of a document-oriented database.

### Features
- Flexible data structure
- High scalability
- Excellent performance
- Support for ACID transactions 

### Advantages: 
- Easy to scale horizontally
- Ideal for handling semi-structured data
- Support for multiple data models 

### Disadvantages
- Lack of strict schema can lead to data inconsistencies
- Limited support for complex queries
- Not suitable for handling complex transactions

### Application
- Content management systems
- E-commerce platforms
- Social media platforms

## Key-value stores
- These databases store data as key-value pairs. 
- Each key is associated with a value, and the data is accessed by its key. 
- Key-value stores are highly scalable and have excellent performance. 
- Redis and Riak are examples of key-value stores.

### Features
- High scalability
- Excellent performance
- Simple data model
- Support for ACID transactions

### Advantages
- Easy to scale horizontally
- Ideal for handling large volumes of data
- Simple and fast data access

### Disadvantages
- Limited support for complex queries
- Not suitable for handling complex transactions
- Lack of strict schema can lead to data inconsistencies
### Application
- Session management
- Caching
- Real-time analytics
