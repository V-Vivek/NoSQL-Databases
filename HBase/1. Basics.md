## What is HBase?
- HBase is a column-oriented data storage architecture that is formed on top of HDFS to overcome its limitations. 
- It leverages the basic features of HDFS and builds upon it to provide scalability by handling a large volume of the read and write requests in real-time. 
- Although the HBase architecture is a NoSQL database, it eases the process of maintaining data by distributing it evenly across the cluster. This makes accessing and altering data in the HBase data model quick

## Components

### HMaster
- HMaster operates similar to its name. 
- It is the master that assigns regions to Region Server (slave). 
- HBase architecture uses an Auto Sharding process to maintain data. In this process, whenever an HBase table becomes too long, it is distributed by the system with the help of HMaster. 
- Some of the typical responsibilities of HMaster includes:
1. Control the failover
2. Manage the Region Server and Hadoop cluster
3  Handle the DDL operations such as creating and deleting tables
4. Manage changes in metadata operations
5  Manage and assign regions to Region Servers
6. Accept requests and sends it to the relevant Region Server
