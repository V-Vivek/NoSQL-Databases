## What is HBase?
- HBase is a column-oriented data storage architecture that is formed on top of HDFS to overcome its limitations. 
- It leverages the basic features of HDFS and builds upon it to provide scalability by handling a large volume of the read and write requests in real-time. 
- Although the HBase architecture is a NoSQL database, it eases the process of maintaining data by distributing it evenly across the cluster. This makes accessing and altering data in the HBase data model quick
