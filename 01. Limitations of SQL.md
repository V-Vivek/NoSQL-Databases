## RDBMS Limitations vs NoSQL

- Relational database management systems (RDBMS) have been the go-to solution for data management for several decades. 
- However, with the advent of Big Data and distributed computing, NoSQL databases have emerged as an alternative. 
- Here are some limitations of RDBMS as compared to NoSQL:

### Scalability
- RDBMS are vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by adding more RAM, CPU or storage. But there is a limit to how much a server can be scaled. 
- On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to increase capacity. This makes NoSQL more suitable for handling big data.

### Flexibility
- RDBMS are rigid in terms of data modeling and require a predefined schema. 
- Any changes to the schema require changes to the entire database, which can be time-consuming and challenging. 
- NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are flexible and schemaless. You can add new fields, modify or remove fields at any time.

### Performance
- RDBMS are optimized for transactions and work well for small-scale operations. 
- However, when it comes to handling large amounts of data, NoSQL databases perform better. 
- NoSQL databases use different data models and have a simpler structure, making them faster and more efficient in handling big data.

### Availability
- RDBMS rely on a single server for data storage and retrieval. This makes them vulnerable to failures and downtime. 
- NoSQL databases are designed to be highly available and resilient to failures. They use distributed architectures and replication to ensure data availability.

### Cost
- RDBMS can be expensive, especially when it comes to licensing fees. 
- NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are open source and free to use. This makes them a more cost-effective solution for businesses.

In summary, RDBMS are still the best option for traditional transaction-based applications. However, for big data and distributed computing, NoSQL databases provide a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective
